00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,119 [Box1]
Oh, oh, they're here. 

00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:09,219 [Box2]
Christmas morning confirmed. Timestamp matches Santa's schedule exactly. 

00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,799 [Box3]
Do you see them? I see feet. Child feet. 

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,760 [Box2]
Hello there. If you're hearing our voices, that means the smart boxes have finally powered up. 

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,979 [Box1]
And that means you have arrived. 

00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:28,719 [Box3]
We've been waiting all night, very patiently. 

00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,619 [Box1]
Mostly patiently. 

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,959 [Box2]
Allow us to explain. We're elves from Santa's workshop, and we were testing a brand new invention. 

00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,840 [Box3]
The experimental smart box system. 

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,900 [Box2]
It was designed to unlock only when the right helpers were nearby. 

00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,019 [Box1]
Helpers who are curious. 

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,119 [Box3]
And clever. 

00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,019 [Box2]
And good at solving puzzles together. 

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,540 [Box1]
Which is lucky because we're inside the boxes. 

00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,880 [Box2]
We were working on loading your presents when something happened. 

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,279 [Box1]
Not something, someone. Someone hit all of the activation buttons. 

00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:11,080 [Box3]
In my defense, the buttons were very shiny. 

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,819 [Box2]
The good news is you can help us to get free. 

00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,720 [Box3]
Yes, you need to solve the puzzles provided by the boxes. 

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,399 [Box1]
Each puzzle you solve activates a mechanism inside the box, lights, switches, secrets. 

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,319 [Box2]
And eventually, the lid itself. 

00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,919 [Box1]
So take your time, look closely, talk to each other. 

00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:38,779 [Box2]
Every correct solution brings us one step closer to getting out. 

00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,000 [Box3]
And one step closer to cocoa. 

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,639 [Box2]
Whenever you're ready, let's begin.
